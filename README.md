# Prediction-Of-Loan-Eligibility-using-Machine-Learning

  Intoduction 
  
  In the banking industries the loans are the most important element of every banks. The main profit for the bank comes directly from the loan’s interest. The loan companies grant a loan after an intensive process of verification and validation. However, they still don’t have idea that the applicant will be able to repay the loan with no difficulties

Objective 

  The main Objective Of the model to Predict if an Applicant is ableto repay the loan to the lending company or not by analysing the factor which is given in the dataset. In this project we have been made a classification model for loan prediction.
  
  
  Dataset Description
  
  The dataset used in our project is "Loan_csv" which is gathered from the Kaggle.com. It is a very useful site for finding different dataset for testing our skills in the Data Science and Machine Learning. Kaggle has dataset of different type and size from 1 MB to 100 GB.
  
  Methodology
  
  Data Collection, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualisation & Machine Learning Model.
  
  Machine Learning Techniques is used     
  
        Logistic Regression, Decision Tree & Random Forest.
        
        Conclusion
        
          By using the different factors in the dataset and by the machine learinig techniques we can predict the loan eligibility.
